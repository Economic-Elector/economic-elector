# Economic Elector

## Description

Every candidate said they would support infrastructure, education, no taxes, and every other nice thing. Economic Elector is an application that allows users to see the actual budget commitments behind these promises. The application has two authorization levels, users and administrators.

Users can see a list of elections and each candidate in those elections. They can also input their ideal budget and compare it to each candidate's proposed budget.

Administators can see, add, edit, and delete elections as well as candidates and their budgets.
