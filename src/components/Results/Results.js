// Displays list of candidates most closely aligned to the user in order of lowest total difference between categories. There will also be a “Back to Budget” button which will bring

// First Responders, Public Works, Administration, and Community Development. Our wireframe software only allowed us to include three columns in the table below, but in the actual web app, each category will have a column.
